📊 City Live Report Card – National-Scale E-Governance Initiative (India)
📌 Concept Overview

The City Live Report Card is an official government-backed digital governance platform that provides a real-time, ward-wise performance dashboard of all civic services in a city.

It acts as a daily-updated public accountability system, enabling citizens, administrators, and policymakers to track service delivery, efficiency, and responsiveness at the grassroots level.
